            "we're full-time now!",
            "at the start of the week, i was daunted by the idea of learning full-time, and didn't know how to organize my time given the changes to the class structure. my plan was to jump in feet-first with the projects, and try not to spend too much time caught up in the docs.",
            "there were pros and cons to this approach. on the plus side, i felt like i had plenty of time to work through my projects. but i also think i moved more slowly in my projects than if i'd spent more time in the docs first. also, i have to catch up with the reading this weekend.",
            "this week i also put a damper on my creative mind, focusing primarily on the project descriptions rather than adding on my own silly twists. i did this to ensure i had enough time to meet the week's goals. but one result is that i felt less enthusiastic about this week's projects than i felt about some of the projects we did in prework.",
            "now that i have a feel for the workload, i'm planning to go into next week with my creative mind turned back on. i'm also hoping to find a more balanced approach between reading and coding.",
            "this week, my underdeveloped pseudocoding and commenting habits held me back most. in pseudocoding, i didn't think through all steps of the projects, and so i wound up doing some things differently or less efficiently than i had originally planned. i think there's a balance to find in pseudocoding specificity as i continue through the course.",
            "as for comments: i left most of my notes about my code in my git commit messages rather than inside of the code. that made it hard to explain to other people what my code was doing afterwards (i can't hold all that in memory!!). next week i'm going to try commenting really aggressively.",
            "it's still hard for me to juggle all the new things we're learning when planning for a new project, so i'm looking forward to learning more and getting lots more practice in the coming months. regarding JSON data, i'd like to learn about loading in data from open sources. as for bootstrap... i just need to learn about best practices for making functional things look good!

            "i like that the long-term, widespread usage of HTML, CSS, and Javascript has driven development of a powerful variety of capabilities, and that there are active communities developing and improving these tools. on the flip side, this means that there's a huge number of elements, attributes, and functions to learn about, which feels daunting. fortunately, i'm walking a well-worn path, so it seems easy to find documentation and help when necessary.",

            "i wonder what it would be like if one language had developed to handle all these aspects. would it be easier to use, without juggling different syntax? would it even work? does such a language exist?",
            "my biggest challenge during pre-work has been wrangling my creative ideas. the ideas i have on top of the MVP have had me spending more time than strictly necessary on a few of the projects. still, that's not such a bad thing, because i enjoy thinking creatively and figuring out how to do stuff.",
            "our daily standups were the biggest help during the pre-work phase. it's been great to be able to ask questions every day. reporting on my progress to the group regularly has helped me keep my projects moving.",

            "my future self may laugh at this, but i'll say it: html makes sense to me! i've got lots to learn, but it seems straightforward. however, i need more practice using css to put the html elements where i want them and make them look beautiful. this weekend i'm planning to get some gamified css practice.",
            "javascript is making sense to me too. based on the kata practice, i know that i don't always come up with the most elegant, simple solutions for a given problem, but i'm sure i'll learn better methods over time. i'm also moving slow with the syntax - it's pretty different from the languages i have the most experience with - but that will come with time and practice too.",
            "i'm enjoying discovering the interplay between these three languages. i like learning about how they've developed over time, how the standards evolve, and how the different browsers handle them. it's neat to learn about best practices for managing their interplay on a website, and the factors that inform developers' decisions.",

            "this week we practiced some intense pseudocoding. i liked it! this exercise was hypothetical - we pseudocoded something we aren't actually going to build - so i took the opportunity to do something fun. i dreamed up a scifi bot (the ensweaterator) that searches for people who are cold, then knits sweaters directly onto their bodies.",
            "because this exercise was hypothetical, i had a little fun and made some decisions about my bot that wouldn't be practical or ethical in real life. some of these decisions, like making the bot a drone so that it could knit sweaters in mid-air, were just for fun. others decisions - including that there is no way for a person to give consent to be ensweaterated, and very little regard for the person's safety - are commentary on some people's approaches to developing new technology (approaches that i wholeheartedly oppose in real life).",
            "this week i felt a bit better about my timing. at the beginning of the week, i looked ahead and planned out a schedule for the week's assignments, which i managed to stick to.",
            "still, there was a lot to do, and at times it was a struggle. this was especially true on wednesday, when it came time to brainstorm and begin the pseudocoding exercise. it took me a while to decide what to pseudocode, and then to wrangle my creative brain into a state of focus and execution. i don't think this was just because my robot was hypothetical; i'm sure the same would be true of a new software idea with open-ended possibilities. i have the impression that some of my classmates struggled with the same thing.",
            "finally, this week i learned a lot more about html and css. i've spent some time cleaning up the code for this blog. the layout still needs work, but it felt important to me to clean up the underlying code before messing around with the cosmetics. that's more work for next week - and now that i know a little more, i'm looking forward to it!"

            "in planning and developing the bare bones of this blog, i've started confronting the gap between what i know about web development, and what i'd like to know. i guess i was already aware of that gap, and that's why i'm taking this course. i'm excited to begin filling in that gap - especially by learning more about javascript, and making websites interactive and functional.",
