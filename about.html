            <p>my name is Becky, and i'm a newcomer to Lexington KY. i just moved here from Edinburgh, Scotland. i've
                also
                lived in Philadelphia PA, and i grew up in Derby CT.</p>
            <p>i've worked a broad variety of jobs, and i can't wait to see what comes next! most recently, i worked as Lead
                Data Engineer for a company that makes speech technology primarily used in video games. before that, i
                helped homeless men study and apply for educational and vocational credentials. two decades ago, i got my first job ever as
                a cashier at Wendy's.</p>
            <p>here are some of the things that motivate me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>sustainability</li>
                <li>design</li>
                <li>science</li>
                <li>creativity</li>
                <li>social cooperation</li>
            </ul>
