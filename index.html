            <p>whoa, the pre-work phase is already over! it's been a lot of work learning how to use these new tools,
                and there's still a lot i haven't fully grasped.</p>
            <p>i like that the long-term, widespread usage of HTML, CSS, and Javascript has driven development of a
                powerful variety of capabilities, and that there are active communities developing and improving these
                tools. on the flip side, this means that there's a huge number of elements, attributes, and functions to
                learn about, which feels daunting. fortunately, i'm walking a well-worn path, so it seems easy to find
                documentation and help when necessary.</p>
            <p>it's cool that these three separate languages developed in tandem for handling these three aspects of web
                development. i do think it works well, and i've been structuring my workflow around these three aspects:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>build the basic HTML structure of the page</li>
                <li>do a bit of prettifying with CSS</li>
                <li>plug in all the functionality with Javascript</li>
            </ol>
            <p>i think i'll try flipping steps 2 and 3 next time.</p>
            <p>i wonder what it would be like if one language had developed to handle all these aspects. would it be
                easier to use, without juggling different syntax? would it even work? does such a language exist?</p>
            <p>my biggest challenge during pre-work has been wrangling my creative ideas. the ideas i have on top of the
                MVP have had me spending more time than strictly necessary on a few of the projects. still, that's not
                such a bad thing, because i enjoy thinking creatively and figuring out how to do stuff.</p>
            <p>our daily standups were the biggest help during the pre-work phase. it's been great to be able to ask
                questions every day. reporting on my progress to the group regularly has helped me keep my projects
                moving.</p>
            <p>this part-time phase has also been helpful for figuring out what i have the capacity to do, how to
                prioritize my goals, and how to maintain balance. i hope i can continue to do this going into the
                full-time phase, although it's clear to me that it's going to be hard!</p>

            <p>this week we learned more about html and css, then added javascript to complete the beautiful layer
                cake of programming languages that we'll use for front-end development. i know i still have <em>a
                    lot</em> to learn about all three, but i'm already excited about what i've been able
                to do with my blog!</p>
            <p>this week's updates include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>css code cleanup</li>
                <li>formatting and color makeover</li>
                <li>interactive buttons that expand to display blog posts</li>
                <li>a nav bar, and the base structure for the new pages it points to</li>
            </ul>
            <p>there's still more to do, but i feel good about my progress.</p>
            <p>my future self may laugh at this, but i'll say it: html makes sense to me! i've got lots to learn,
                but it seems straightforward. however, i need more practice using css to put the html elements where i
                want them and make them look beautiful. this weekend i'm planning to get some gamified css practice.</p>
            <p>javascript is making sense to me too. based on the kata practice, i know that i don't always come up
                with the most elegant, simple solutions for a given problem, but i'm sure i'll learn better methods over
                time. i'm also moving slow with the syntax - it's pretty different from the languages i have the most
                experience with - but that will come with time and practice too.</p>
            <p>i'm enjoying discovering the interplay between these three languages. i like learning about how they've
                developed over time, how the standards evolve, and how the different browsers handle them. it's neat to
                learn about best practices for managing their interplay on a website, and the factors that inform
                developers' decisions.</p>
            <p>what's next? :)</p>

            <p>this week we practiced some intense pseudocoding. i liked it! this exercise was hypothetical - we
                pseudocoded something we aren't actually going to build - so i took the opportunity to do something
                fun. i dreamed up a scifi bot (the ensweaterator) that searches for people who are cold, then knits
                sweaters directly onto their bodies.</p>
            <p>because this exercise was hypothetical, i had a little fun and made some decisions about my bot that
                wouldn't be practical or ethical in real life. some of these decisions, like making the bot a drone
                so that it could knit sweaters in mid-air, were just for fun. others decisions - including that
                there is no way for a person to give consent to be ensweaterated, and very little regard for the
                person's safety - are commentary on some people's approaches to developing new technology
                (approaches that i wholeheartedly oppose in real life).</p>
            <p>this week i felt a bit better about my timing. at the beginning of the week, i looked ahead and
                planned out a schedule for the week's assignments, which i managed to stick to.</p>
            <p>still, there was a lot to do, and at times it was a struggle. this was especially true on wednesday,
                when it came time to brainstorm and begin the pseudocoding exercise. it took me a while to decide
                what to pseudocode, and then to wrangle my creative brain into a state of focus and execution. i
                don't think this was just because my robot was hypothetical; i'm sure the same would be true of a
                new software idea with open-ended possibilities. i have the impression that some of my classmates
                struggled with the same thing.</p>
            <p>finally, this week i learned a lot more about html and css. i've spent some time cleaning up the code
                for this blog. the layout still needs work, but it felt important to me to clean up the underlying
                code before messing around with the cosmetics. that's more work for next week - and now that i know
                a little more, i'm looking forward to it!</p>

            <p>what a week!</p>
            <p>this week's coursework met my expectations in some ways; where it didn't, it exceeded them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>i expected the instructors to share excellent resources with us. i didn't expect quite so many
                    resources!</li>
                <li>i expected to spend all of my afternoons stuffing new information into my head. i didn't expect
                    my learning time to stretch well into my evenings (and to feel so motivated to spend that extra
                    time on the course).</li>
                <li>i expected to learn just a little bit more about web development. i didn't expect to learn such
                    a clear, straightforward approach to managing my local development environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>my biggest struggle this week has been <i>taking it all in.</i> i tend to read things very thoroughly
                - i worry that i'll miss something if i just skim. about halfway through the week i realized that i
                had to speed up to meet the demo deadline, so i started moving faster. i'm nervous about keeping up
                with the pace in the coming weeks, but i'm up for the challenge.</p>
            <p>in planning and developing the bare bones of this blog, i've started confronting the gap between what
                i know about web development, and what i'd like to know. i guess i was already aware of that gap,
                and that's why i'm taking this course. i'm excited to begin filling in that gap - especially by
                learning more about javascript, and making websites interactive and functional.</p>
            <p>i'm also looking forward to working with my instructors and classmates more, and getting to know
                everyone better!</p>
