            <h2>pre-work week 1</h2>
            <p>what a week!</p>
            <p>this week's coursework met my expectations in some ways; where it didn't, it exceeded them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>i expected the instructors to share excellent resources with us. i didn't expect quite so many resources!</li>
                <li>i expected to spend all of my afternoons stuffing new information into my head. i didn't expect my learning time to stretch well into my evenings (and to feel so motivated to spend that extra time on the course).</li>
                <li>i expected to learn just a little bit more about web development. i didn't expect to learn a such clear, straightforward approach to managing my local development environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>my biggest struggle this week has been <i>taking it all in.</i> i tend to read things very thoroughly - i worry that i'll miss something if i just skim. about halfway through the week i realized that i had to speed up to meet the demo deadline, so i started moving faster. i'm nervous about keeping up with the pace in the coming weeks, but i'm up for the challenge.</p>
            <p>in planning and developing the bare bones of this blog, i've started confronting the gap between what i know about web development, and what i'd like to know. i guess i was already aware of that gap, and that's why i'm taking this course. i'm excited to begin filling in that gap - especially by learning more about javascript, and making websites interactive and functional.</p>
            <p>i'm also looking forward to working with my instructors and classmates more, and getting to know everyone better!</p>
