            "i'm finding React super powerful. i'm really glad we no longer need to write our own Javascript function to dynamically create HTML elements! it's rough to imagine writing the to-do list project without a framework, especially given all the bootstrap elements that i used for it. any project that requires a lot of HTML elements - especially elements that share features, like the menu items on the restaurant project - would be a huge pain without dynamic rendering.",
            "we also started using firebase this week. i've been using the command line for years, so the concept of a CLI isn't new or scary to me - i find the command line really powerful and fun to use. while i've never built a true CLI, i have built a family of Python and Shell scripts around a PostgreSQL database, using Git and Data Version Control. my scripts dynamically accessed a huge collection of speech audio data and all its associated metadata to run version-controlled machine learning experiments. there is currently no out-of-the-box solution for this - so maybe, if i were to build my own CLI, it would be something along these lines :)",
            "i'm ending this week feeling really good about my progress - today i told my partner that i think i now feel comfortable saying that i know how to make web apps. i feel apprehensive about next week's projects, but i'm hoping to find more chances to learn collaboratively with my classmates."
